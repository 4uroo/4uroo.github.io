<p> Tody. This is probably one of the most important dates in every year. This is the day we officially started dating.
I know we both told eachother we were gay and that we liked eachother but it still took me a week. 
That was for a few reasons but they're not important.
We talking about being more than random inbetween things. Not girlfriends not just at talking stage.
We had talked about stepping it up to calling eachother girlfriends.
Today was the day, I met you after you had work on the 10th of December. I waited outside for you to come out.
We have a running joke about how bad I a a cooking and baking. 
You even joked that I was so bad I could cook brownies and they look pink, I think I might have said something about making you pink brownies.
Also, I knew your extreme love of satsumas.
So to ask you out, I spent a while making my first ever brownies from scratch, and decorating them with pink icing.
Then, I used a scalpel and cut into the peel of a satsuma. I made a load of little notes, they were layers. 
Each was some sort of satsuma pun and in the centre the last note was asking you to be my girlfriend.
So, I put these notes inside the satsuma, between the actualy fruit and the peel, then I superglued it up.
Because the scalpel is so thin you couldn't really tell it had been cut into or altered unless you looked really close.
So armed with the pink brownies and special satsuma I met you at your work when your shift had ended.
I gave you the brownies and got you to peel the satsuma.
You read the puns and laughed. You got to the final note (I did tell you you could keep the brownies even if you said no like I wasn't going to blackmail you with food- that's low)
You read it and you hugged me and then you said yes (after I asked if that meant a yes or a no).
It was raining and so you gave me that scarf. Your scarf.
I will forever remember this day and how much you mean to me. Always.
I love you.
