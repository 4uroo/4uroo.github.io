<p> Today. A date to celebrate every year. This is the day we officially started dating.
I know we both told eachother we were gay and that we liked eachother but it still took me a week to do anything about it, helped along by heavy hinting from you.
Today was the day, I met you after you had work on the 10th of December.
We have a running joke about how bad I was at cooking and baking; you even joked that I was so bad I could cook brownies and they look pink.
Also, at this point you sort of had a thing for satsumas.
So to ask you out, I spent a while making my first ever brownies from scratch, and decorating them with pink icing.
Then, I used a scalpel and cut into the peel of a satsuma. I made a load of little notes, and folded them into layers. 
Each was some sort of satsuma pun and in the centre the last note was asking you to be my girlfriend.
So, I put these notes inside the satsuma, between the actual fruit and the peel, then I superglued it up to look normal. (putting super glue all over my hands as usual)
So armed with pink brownies and special satsuma I met you at your work when your shift had ended.
I gave you the brownies and got you to peel the satsuma.
You read the puns and finally got to the last note (I did tell you you could keep the brownies even if you said no like I wasn't going to brownie blackmail you)
You read it and you hugged me and then you said yes (after I asked if that meant a yes or a no).
It was raining and you gave my your scarf, I wore it for days.
I will forever remember this day and how much you mean to me.
I love you.
