<p> Right so this one doesnt really have any pictures as we didn't think it was that big of a deal.
This date is the date that I sent you the first message we ever exchanged.
You had asked everyone to remind you to buy Lauras birthday present and I was shopping later that day and it reminded me so I told you.
It was a snapchat and I remember you calling me a trash queen.
