<p> Right so this one doesnt have any pictures as we didn't know what it really meant at the time.
This date is the date that I sent you the first message we ever exchanged.
You had asked everyone to remind you to buy your friends birthday present and I was shopping later that day and it reminded me so I text you to remind you.
It was a snapchat and it was a pretty normal convo, I remember you calling me a trash queen because at lunch you used to collect up everyones rubbish and give it to me. </p>
