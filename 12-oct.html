<p> So, this is my first ever impression of you. 
This is the day we all played the Tricky test on my phone and also the same day you got into Hannah's locker.
It's safe to say my first impression was strange, goofy but mainly funny. (And also hella impressive like woah how small are you to actually fit into a locker)
But still, I saw you and I noticed you and I laughed with you and I think that says a lot.
You were a goof from the start. And I loved it then and I love you now. </p>
