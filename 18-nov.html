</p> This is the inset day on Tuesday the 18th of November.
Istayed at Kerries and I can't quite remember how but this is the day we properly started talking, and we haven't stopped talking since then.
This day only gets more and more significant as I find out more.
For example, you don't usually talk to people. You always ignore them if anything. Laura is your bestfriend and you'd still ignore her. Yet you spoke to me. And you kept speaking to me.
Another thing to note is that I know you get a famously terrible amount of data on your contract yet you spent it all snapchating me and then you even paid for me.
Also you spoke to me throughout rangers and thats also a pretty big things.
This day will alwyas be funny as I will always rememebr Rangers as Disney Monopoly Club because thats all you did that day there.
I will always look back on this day and smile, but more importantly, be grateful.
