<p> This is the day of the kiss "fun" run. 
Like I know this wasn't exactly a huge moment in our relationship but it's still crazy to think neither of us knew we'd be dating in the future.
Also we have some cute pictures.
And I think I should tell you that I literally carried Ginger on my back to catch up with you and if that's not some suppressed gay then what is?
