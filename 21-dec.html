<p> This is the first time you slept round my house. I remember how excited I was.
I even started thinking baout all the small things like how cooked you liked the bacon I would make you in the morning to the extent that I sent you different pictures of crispy bacon to see which you liked.

<p> That night was amazing and we had many long, deep conversations. I can safely say I've shared more with you than anyone else. I knew from that night how much you meant to me.It was filled with laughter and good feelings and so much.
