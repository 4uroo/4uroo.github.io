<p> Today was a non-uniform day and one in which we really bonded. 
I took a few silly snapchats of you and we took our first picture together.
I remember sitting in history as me, you and laura just spoke about things and had a laugh.
This was a great day and we definitely liked eachother at least a bit at this point.
