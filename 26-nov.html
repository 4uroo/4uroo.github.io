<p> This is a pretty funny one. Short but goofy. 
The only pictures I could put on this ones are the ones of me drunk and none of them have you in and that's not the point.
So this one is purely text.
Basically, this is the day I went to a Marriott's party and kinda just prefered speaking to you all night.
Although a girl did try to kiss me there and I rememeber being repulsed and happy I wasn't gay. 
But I hadn't thought that it might not depend on the gender, but the person.
When I got home me and you had some real conversations and you told me that you were gay.
You told me about coming out to Laura.
I can't actually remembered what I replied to this but at this points I had thought about perhaps being gay for a while and I remember being happy.
Main point is, I stupidly fell asleep shortly after.
When I woke up I assumed I had dreamt it.
I remember thinking how creepy I was, and then thinking I was seriosuly gay if I had dreamt about you telling me you were gay.
I also sent you a load of messages in the morning and I worked up the courage to ask if you really were gay.
You never replied to that message so I assumed you had ignored or because you thought I was a creep or weirdo.
Speaking to you now I know you don't think you got that message, and that's what makes this day so funny becasue it's a collection of misunderstandings.
