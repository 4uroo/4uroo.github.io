<p> So, the 28th of October is the day of Anna-Marie's first party and a lot happened this night.
Aside from the general good memories and laughs that happened that night, I'm talking about the most important, you.
This is the night that I still had only really spoken to you twice or so.
You came up to me and just grabbed my hand and marched off with me and Laura.
This has to be time I noticed you most, you just took charge and we all had an amazing evening.
This is probably the first time I considered maybe being gay </p>
