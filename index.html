<p> Julia, I made you this website because since I first learnt the basic of html code I know you wanted me to make you a website, so I have finally pulled my finger out and made you this poor-excuse for a website. Also, I know you loved the show 13 reasons why so I have made my own 13 reasons why I made this for you: </p>

<img alt="You ma P.I.C dawg" src="website/website-dogcute.JPG" height="350px" width="300px">

<p> I made this for many reasons. One being that you wanted me to make it a while ago (I know you were joking but you know more that I'm extra) </p>

<img alt="I love your top and your hair like that" src="website/website-rabbitschool.jpg" height="300px" width="400px">

<p> Another being that it makes me seem smart (totally the main one yup)</p>

<img alt="I know you love this picture" src="website/website-partylie.jpg" height="300px" width="450px">

<p> Another being that we are both forgetful, and we aren't the most lucky with technology and should our phones fail we will have this to remeber things with.</p>

<img alt="This is my second ever instagram" src="website/website-flowergrey.JPG" height="400px" width="300px">

<p>Another is that I know you love organised thing so what better to do than organise ou relationship into cute little parts.</p>

<img alt="A rightful crown upon a queen's head" src="website/website-flowercrown.JPG" height="400px" width="300px">

<p> Another is to love you in a way that is as unique as you. So I have personally written every line of code behind this website. Right down to the RGB levels in eah colour.</p>

<img alt="I don't carrot all who see's this bomb picture" src="website/website-royalrabbit.JPG" height="400px" width="300px">

<p> Another reason is so that anyone worldwide can know I have the best girlfirend</p>

<img alt="This just speaks for itself. Iconic" src="website/website-dog-eye.JPG" height="400px" width="300px">

<p> Another is as an attempt to pay you back for the multitude of personal, well -thought-out and cute things you have done for me. </p>

<img alt="There is that perfect smile. For the cookie obvs" src="website/website-cookie.JPG" height="400px" width="300px">

<p> Another is because we are infinite and so is this website. </p>

<img alt="Goofy" src="website/website-royaldog2.JPG" height="400px" width="300px">

<p> Another reason is because nobody else seems to appreicate you enough so you ar emore than owed a few hundred websites.</p>

<img alt="Beautiful in all colours" src="website/website-handface.JPG" height="400px" width="300px">

<p> Another is because you inspire me to do things I would never do before in order to woo you (jkjk me fair maiden fam) </p>

<img alt="More sunny days on the field like this please" src="website/website-flowersun.JPG" height="400px" width="300px">

<p> Another reason is to see you smile when you read all of this, and hopefully use it when you are feeling bad.</p>

<img alt="You're perfect shoulder height" src="website/website-royaldog.JPG" height="400px" width="300px">

<p> the main reason being that I love you, and I plan to damn well show that in any form. Including a website.</p>

<img alt="You make me nuts but ily" src="website/website-squirrel.JPG" height="400px" width="300px">

<p>So, while this website may be kinda poor and have its glitches. It is yours.(lol @me) </p>

<img alt="You are most beautiful when you smile" src="website/website-happycute.JPG" height="350px" width="300px">
