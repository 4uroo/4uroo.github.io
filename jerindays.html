<h3> Jerin Day 2017 </h3>
<p>
Okay, I'm not sure how to structure this so just tell me if you want it any other way or if I miss stuff which is quite likely.
So we both agreed that Valentines Day is a bit depressing. It's mostly a market to sell more things and it promotes bad relationships. 
We belive that if you're in love you should show that love all year round, not just on one day.
We also believe it makes people that are single unnecessarily sad for no reason.
We are happy to dedicate February 14th to friends and spend time with them, and have another big day for us some other time.
In 2017, that was the 13th of February.
We started off by meeting at the train station and then getting a train down to Cambridge. 
You took me to Carluccios (which is an amazing Italian restaurant. which is significant because we had wanted to go to an Italian restuarant for ages). 
It was really cute, I remember feeling the sugar and it felt weird in the packet so i got you to feel it and abviously you completely popped the sugar packet open, showing us both with brown sugar. But still we laughed and laughed and I thought it was such an accurate description for us, and we made a pretty good heart out of all of it too.
After that we went for a walk around Cambridge, went across a bridge and walked round some grass. It was lovely, we exchanged gifts. Yours was bloody amazing. The breakfast, the sweet treat box, the punny card. It was all so good and I loved it.
We took some really cute polaroids, some crazy erect hat woman even joined in.
Overall it was just an incredible day, made veen better by being with you.
